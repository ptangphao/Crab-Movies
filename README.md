# PaperClip

This is a web application that is designed to allow people to rate and review films. By registering with our site, we permit users to rate and review movie titles, actors and actresses as well as comment. The goal of this application is to help people traverse their movie decisions by providing a platform that will foster unbiased opinions. 

### Dependencies for local development:

* Ruby (2.3.1)
* Rails (4.2)

## Running the tests

We have extensivly tested this repository to demonstrate the intent of our functionality and better articultae our motives, as well as track the feasibility of our app. 

### A break down of our tests

In the terminal
```
bundle
be rake db:create
be rake db:migrate
be rspec
```

All tests should pass
Or you can run:

```
be rspec ./spec/models/
```
...to see all specs related to our models.
Or run 

```
be rspec ./spec/mailers/
```
...to see all specs related to our mailers

We also have tests for our `controllers`, `helpers` and `routes`.
Thanks for testing us!
